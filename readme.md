## DAT 550 project
Implementation of a case study for COVID-19 based on [kaglle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)

## Abstract

The abrupt appearance of COVID-19 in the world and its respective identification in December 2019 is a global phenomenon that highlighted the shortcomings and instability of society in various countries, and whose consequences will change the course of humanity in all its fields. Little could society know months before how devastating and fast this disease would be. By the time this report is written most of the countries have reached the so called "peak of the curve" and a further understanding of the disease, scientific collaboration and vaccine preparation is being observed.

On the technical side, this phenomenon is  a peculiar milestone. It is astonishing how fast the scientific community collaborated and joined forces with doctors, virologists and researches from many different branches over the world to fight the virus. In particular, the amount of information generated regarding studies, discoveries, news and political social economical situations is massive, and still ongoing. Perhaps like no other time ever before, the amount of information generated flooded social media, web portals, research sites to the point it is hard to follow up and get accurate, distilled information that can lead to the progress on the understanding of this disease.

This report shows the application of Natural Language Processing tools with unsupervised learning Clustering techniques that help get a general overview over a big data set containing over 63,000 scholarly articles about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses provided  by Kaggle\cite{covid_kaggle_source}, the employed techniques, relevant questions, statistics and results are presented with the possibility to use this research for future developments.


## The Tasks we are intending to explain are:
- Scientific community contributions by nationality and the impact on the covid
- Year of submissions and the wrogth throughout the time
- Text classification based on the common subjects
- Paper language identification and potential translation
- Map visualization and creation of a knowledge base that allows the scientific community easily access and identify papers by nationality
- Scientific contribution map which will display the knowledge field based on text analysis and the experience on the matter.
